# Contact List App

Personal project using SQFlite plugin to storage a list of contacts in a database, with some functionality of add, edit and exlude contacts of the database.

## Some observations

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

→ In this app, I learn to use singleton pattern as a utility class, when all the database methods can be accessed on any local of the code, instantiating(referenciating) always the same database.

→ The use of SQlite plugin is very intuitive, allowing to use query commands of SQL without any difficulty that can stop your project.

→ Use of asynchronous functions because the database functions is not instantaneously executed, and most of all the returns were able in a future, so the use of asynchronous function was very useful ableing others methods to catch this return in the end of anterior method.
